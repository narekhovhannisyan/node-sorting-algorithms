## Bubble Sort

### Overview
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, 
is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, 
compares adjacent pairs and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. 

### Performance
Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of О(n^2), 
where n is the number of items being sorted. 
Most practical sorting algorithms have substantially better worst-case or average complexity, 
often O(n log n). Even other О(n^2) sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort,  
generally run faster than bubble sort, and are no more complex.  
Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm.
